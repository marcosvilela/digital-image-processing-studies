# digital-image-processing-studies
A repository to feature files used on the study of Digital Image Processing, using OpenCV an Python. It's entirely educational and non-profitable. 

I'm using [sentdex's youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z78zbnLlPUA&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdttJXlLtAJxJetJcqmqlQq) as a basis for my studies, so all rights (and accolades) goes to him and his great teaching.
